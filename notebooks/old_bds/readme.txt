This file contains notebooks for the results of old bounds, i.e, 

# taue, taui, tauC, speed, alpha, gii, gei
par_low = np.asarray([0.005,0.005,0.005,1.7,0.1,0.5,0.5])
par_high = np.asarray([0.03, 0.20, 0.03,5.3,  1, 10, 10])

After 10th Dec, we use new bounds to make sure the fourier transform is table.
